# MCSCoursework

This is my coursework repository for my time at the MCS crash course on iOS development.
This repo is organized with each branch being the assignments for a given date, dated in HW[MM/DD/YY] format. Aside from the first, HW assignments themselves will be raised as issues and closed as completed.
