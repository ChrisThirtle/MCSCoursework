The Apple Store guidelines are a mix of both ethical obligations that are universal to all developers and particular requirements made by Apple. Basic, everyday ethical requirements range from respecting intellectual property and keeping on the right side of local laws, potentially requiring geolocation information to determine if local laws would forbid the usage of an app, as well as keeping age ratings in mind in all aspects of an app. Apple’s more specific rules that are less universal primarily have to do with specific functionalities that they have deemed as requiring extra regulation, such as how in-app purchases work, significant sections on limiting apps from directing users away from the Apple Store or otherwise circumventing the Apple Store, software and hardware requirements to ensure that apps work on all current devices, alongside smaller details like forbidding scraping Apple’s own sites to build RSS feeds off of rather than using Apple’s own feeds. The remaining guidelines are primarily focused on textual or visual content that Apple either wishes to not be associated with or otherwise does not wish to have on the Store, or simply wishes to limit according to reasonable age guidelines.
Overall, the Apple Store guidelines for developers primarily just require that developers remain ethical, work within the bounds of the law, and make good-faith effort to work alongside Apple instead of in opposition to the company in their dealings with consumers.
