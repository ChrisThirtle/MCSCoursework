\f0\fs24 \cf0 The human interface guidelines by and large encourage developers to consider ergonomics and the realities of the devices in use. Emphasis is placed on the location of controls and differentiating view elements from control elements, as well as considerations for portability of an app between iOS and macOS, if applicable.\
Controls and other actionable parts of an app are recommended to follow regular design patterns, typically using the standard appearances for things like buttons. As well, users should receive immediate feedback from using a control, not delayed; this could include haptic feedback with some of iOS\'92s more specialized classes, for mobile devices, to simple aspects like buttons changing appearance to appear \'93pressed\'94 when activated, and being greyed out to indicate inactivity. Positioning, meanwhile, puts emphasis on having controls near the center or corners of the screen for convenience while held in hand.\
Visual design focuses largely on predefined system colors which adapt well to user settings, and on color theory; a large amount of emphasis is placed on contrast in visual design, over simply choice of hue, which is very important when dealing with a wide variety of apps that may have striking appearances from the predefined styles. }
